# grunt-assetsbuilder
Grunt task to build assets from XML configuration pages

## Getting Started
[![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/) <br>
If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-assetsbuilder --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-assetsbuilder');
```

*This plugin was designed to work with Grunt 1.4.x.*
